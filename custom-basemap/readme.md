- On the Styles page, select **“New Style”** > **“Upload”**.

### 3. Upload the JSON File
- Upload the `style.json` file from the GitHub repo.

### 4. Customise the Style
- Use the **Style Editor** to modify the layers, colours, and typography.
- Refer to the tutorial for step-by-step guidance on customising your basemap.
